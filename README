Jotto in C

This is a C implementation of the word game Jotto. 

To play:

  make
  ./jotto

You guess the computer's 5-letter word; it guesses yours. You
response to its guesses by telling it how many hits it has, where
a "hit" is an exact, positional match between letters.

For example, if your word is mouse and the computer guesses manse,
that's three hits. 

Not much more to it.
